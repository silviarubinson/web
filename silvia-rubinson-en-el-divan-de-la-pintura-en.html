<br><h1>Silvia Rubinson, on the painting's divan</h1><br><p>As a psychoanalyst, Silvia Rubinson is used to words. But she appeals to another language, painting, to bring her other Silvia Rubinson to consciousness. She doesn’t haste the image—it emerges slowly, the same way the unconscious is formulated. And she knows about this. Her other profession has shown her the way. Yet, against what outsiders to psychoanalysis and to artistic processes would believe when they relate both terms, there is nothing oneiric or surreal in her work. Its dynamics is abstract, and built with the frankness of someone who has nothing to hide. Like in her speech, the work emerges punctuated by color and gesture. It is formulated with many adjectives, which become explicit through her sense of color, and with almost no nouns. The only image she presents—like someone naming something—is her own work. And the other Silvia Rubinson resembles the first one so much. Like a twin soul.</p><br><p>Luis Felipe Noé<br> Buenos Aires, 2005</p></div><div><br><a class="link-centered-in-full-width" href="textos-en.html">[See more texts]</a><br>
